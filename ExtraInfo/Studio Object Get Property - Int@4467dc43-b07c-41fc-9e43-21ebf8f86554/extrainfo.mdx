### Uses

Can be used to get an Intager number from allowed component values, such as an animation state, a custom int from a canvas, etc.

### Tips

So far, no studio object values are synced by default, so this value will never be the same between players.
Remember to set the string correctly, as this is case sensitive!

### Issues

None so far!
