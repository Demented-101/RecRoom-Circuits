### Uses

None so far!

### Tips

Configuring the chip can allow ignoring players and objects. This means that the ray can move through players or objects based on this configuration. Decoration objects can *not* be detected.

### Issues

The initial sphere around the origin position will ignore all collisions. if you are attempting to find the collisions in this sphere, use an overlap sphere instead.
