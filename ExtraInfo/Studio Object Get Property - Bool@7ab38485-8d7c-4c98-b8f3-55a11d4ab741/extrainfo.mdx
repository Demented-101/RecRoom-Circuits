### Uses

Can be used to get a Boolean value from allowed component values, such as if an object is currently active, an animator variable, if a canvas is active, etc.

### Tips

So far, no studio object values are synced by default, so this value will never be the same between players.
Remember to set the string correctly, as this is case sensitive!

### Issues

None so far!
