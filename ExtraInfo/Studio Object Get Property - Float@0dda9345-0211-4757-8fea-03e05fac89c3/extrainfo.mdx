### Uses
### Uses

Can be used to get a Floating point number from allowed component values, such as the volume of an audio player, or the timestamp of an animation, etc.

### Tips

So far, no studio object values are synced by default, so this value will never be the same between players.
Remember to set the string correctly, as this is case sensitive!

### Issues

None so far!
